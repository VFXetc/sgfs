- Legacy schema.
- Cache lookups by code/name as well as by ID.
- Get setup.py including the schema (via a MANIFEST?).
- Rename some SGFS methods:
    Clumsy or too explicit:
        - get_directory_entity_tags
        - tag_directory_with_entity
    Unify:
        - path_for_entity (only for)
        - entities_from_path
        - entities_in_directory (recursive version of above)
        - context_from_entities
        - context_from_path
