This Python package is a translation layer between Shotgun entities and a file structure on disk. In general, its overarching tasks are to:

- map Shotgun entities to their canonical path on disk;
- map paths on disk to the coresponding Shotgun entities;
- create new structures on disk;
- indentify existing structures on disk for use in above translation.

Stay tuned for documentation!
